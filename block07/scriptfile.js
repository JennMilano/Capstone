//pseudocode: How I will solve this exercise
//Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:
//assign 3 variables
//each variable must equal one of the three codes in the combination
//add comments throughout
//create a dialog box that displays the vault codes and the text, or create a pop up dialog

//create dialog with an alert
alert("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:")


//create first variable using a const variable to equal 10
const first = 5 + 5;

//create second variable using a const variable to equal 40
const second = 41 - 1;

//create third variable using a const variable to equal 39
const third = 1 * 39;

//show combo in alert
alert("Vault Combo is " + first + " - " + second + " - " + third)

//create fun success
alert("YOU'RE IN")
